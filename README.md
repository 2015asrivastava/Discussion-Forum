Discussion Forum is a django web application where user can ask their doubts and other users can answer the doubts.
In order to post a question or to answer a question user need to register at forum.Also user can update or delete the question posted by them on forum.
Registered users can track their asked questions in activity tab.

Also this application has like-dislike system:
User have to be logged in order to like or dislike an answer provided by other members.Also a user can either like or dislike a post.
e.g If for a answer there are 2 likes and 1 dislike and if a user likes an answer likes becomes 3 and dislike remains 1 and if same user dislike that same answer
 then likes becomes 2 and dislike becomes 2.
